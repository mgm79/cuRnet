# cuRnet

> an R package for graph traversing on GPU.

***

**cuRnet** is a package that provides a wrap of parallel graph algorithms developed in **CUDA** for the **R** environment. 
It makes available GPU solutions to R end-users in a transparent way, by including basic data structures for representing graphs,
and parallel implementation of of BFS (Breadth-First Search), SCC (Strongly Connected Components) and SSSP (Single-Source Shortest Paths) customized for biological network analysis on GPUs (Busato and Bombieri, 2016).

**cuRnet** has been tested on different PPI networks provided by the [STRINGdb](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/STRINGdb.html) R package.
**cuRnet** outperformed the standard sequential counterpart provided by the [iGraph](http://igraph.org/r/) R package.

## cuRnet Installation on Ubuntu 20.04

cuRnet has recently been fixed to install with the recent version of compilers on recent Ubuntu releases. Although it should work for other recent versions of Ubuntu linux, here are the steps which can be taken to install cuRnet on Ubuntu 20.04.

### Installation from locally cloned repository

Install nvcc compiler in cuda toolkit by:

```
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

cuRnet expects that cuda is installed in the default location of `/usr/local/cuda` therefore, nvcc is available at `/usr/local/cuda/bin`. If you have installed cuda in a non-standard location, or you have more than one cuda installed, for instance in `/opt/cuda`, you can select the desired version of cuda by setting `CUDA_HOME` environment variable by:

```
export CUDA_HOME=/opt/cuda
```

Install rest of the dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libboost-dev
```
Install R by:

```shell
sudo apt install r-base-core
```

Clone the repository and note down the location.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mgm79/cuRnet.git
```

Let us assume, this repository was cloned at `/data/repositories/cuRnet`. We will need this path later.

Install R dependencies by starting R and typing the following on R prompt

```
install.packages("Rcpp")
```

Finally, install cuRnet by typing the following on R prompt:

```
install.packages("/data/repositories/cuRnet", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

### Installation directly from github repository

cuRnet can be installed directly from github repository as well by using `devtools` package. 

Install dependencies and R by:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install r-base-coreInstall 
```

On the R prompt, type

```
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Finally, install cuRnet by typing the following on R prompt:

```
install_github("mgm79/cuRnet")
```

### Extra requirements to run examples

In order to run the following examples, some extra packages need to be installed. This can be done by typing the following on R prompt

```
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("STRINGdb")
```

### Uninstall cuRnet

cuRnet can be uninstall by typing the following on R prompt

    remove.packages("cuRnet")

# Examples
The following examples are also available as R scripts in `examples/` directory.

## Example: creating a cuRnet graph object

**cuRnet** algorithms run over a **cuRnet** graph object that can be created from a 3-column dataframe.
The dataframe represents edges in the form (source vertex, destination vertex, weight). 
The first two colums are of type *charatcter*, instead weights are of type *numeric*.
Weight column is optional, however it has to be specified for algorithms that require the information, such as SSSP.

The following example shows how to create a cuRnet graph object starting from an *iGraph* one.

```
library(igraph)
library(cuRnet)
rg <- sample_fitness_pl(100, 1000, 2.2, 2.3)
cdf <- data.frame( ends(rg, E(rg))[,1], ends(rg, E(rg))[,2] )
colnames(cdf) <- c("from", "to")
my_graph <- cuRnet_graph(cdf)
```

***

## Example: reading networks from a CSV file

Dataframe objects to be used as input for **cuRnet** can be built from values stored in a textual CSV file. The following example shows how to do it.

The input file *my_file.csv* is a CSV file having 3 columns named *from*, *to* and *score*.<br>
The first line of the CSV file is an header reporting column names.<br>
Identifires of vertices are represented as characters, and score must be positive values.<br>

```
library(igraph)
x <- read.table("my_file.csv", header=TRUE)
```

The input CSV file has an header row specifing column names as *from*, *to* and *score*.

```
x$from <- as.character(x$from)
x$to <- as.character(x$to)
x$score <- abs(x$score)
```

The cuRnet graph can be created from the loaded dataframe.

```
my_graph <- cuRnet_graph(x)
```

***

## Example: Breadth-First Search (BFS).

The BFS function traverses the graph via a breadth-first search from a given set of source vertices, and returns depth of visited nodes.

The reutrn value is a *NumericMatrix* having a number of rows equal to the number of source vertices, and a number of columns equal to the total number of vertices of th input graph. 
Every row corresponds to a specific source vertex, and row cells report the depth from the given source to the correspondig graph vertex.

The following example shows how to perfrom BFS.
The graph is created randomly by using the *iGraph* Power-Law random generation model.

```
library(igraph)
rg <- sample_fitness_pl(100, 1000, 2.2, 2.3)
cdf <- data.frame( ends(rg, E(rg))[,1], ends(rg, E(rg))[,2] )
colnames(cdf) <- c("from", "to")
library(cuRnet)
cg <- cuRnet_graph(cdf)
```

The example performs BFS by choosing the first 20 vertices of the graph as soruce vertices.

```
sources <- union(cdf$from, cdf$to)[1:20]
bfs <- cuRnet_bfs(cg, sources)
```

Each returned row correspond to a given source vertex.

```
bfs[1,]
bfs[2,]
bfs[20,]
```

***

## Example: Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) from a set of vertices.

The following example shows how to calculate distances and predecessors from a set of source vertices.

The examples uses the human (code 9606) PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) network downloaded via the STRINGdb R package (version 10).
STRING networks have scores ranging from 0 to 1000. A threshold of 900 is used.

```
library(STRINGdb)
ss <- STRINGdb$new( version="10", species=9606, score_threshold=900)
```

The network data is available as an *iGraph* object.

```
library(igraph)
g <- ss$get_graph()
```

For the example, the first 10 vertices of the PPI are choosen as source vertex.

```
from <- V(g)$name[1:10]
```

**cuRnet** takes in input a DataFrame having 3 columns. The data frame stores the edges of the network as a list of rows. 
Each row reports the source and destination vertices of the edges and the weight/costs of it.
Weights can be eigther integer or decimal values.
For this example, the combined_score of the iGraph object is firstly normalized and the is is used as weight.

```
x <- data.frame("from" = ends(g,E(g))[,1], 
                "to" = ends(g,E(g))[,2], 
                "score" = E(g)$combined_score/1000)
```

**cuRnet** functions are available by loading the *cuRnet* library.
The **cuRnet_sssp** function takes in input the data frame of the edges and the list of source vertices.

```
library(cuRnet)
cg <- cuRnet_graph(x)
ret <- cuRnet_sssp(cg, from)
```

The **cuRnet_sssp** function returns  a list of two NumericMatrix indexed as *"distances"* and *"predecessors"*.
Matrix rows are source vertices and colums are network vertices. 
A entry fo the *distance* matrix is the distance along the shortest path from the source to the destination vertex.
A entry fo the *predecessors* matrix is a minimal predecessor of the vertex and along the shortest path.

```
dists = ret[["distances"]]
preds = ret[["predecessors"]]
```

The fowlling lines list distances and predecessors from the first source vertex to every other vertex of the input PPI.

```
dists[1,]
preds[1,]
```

***

## Example: computing only distances of shortest paths

**cuRnet** provides two different funcitons for SSSP computation, *cuRnet_sssp* and *cuRnet_sssp_dists*.
Given a network and a set of source vertices, the **cuRnet_sssp_dists** function computes only distance values and ignore predecessors.
The function is intended to be faster than the complete one (*cuRnet_sssp*) and to be used for such applications where predecessor information is not needed.

```
library(STRINGdb)
ss <- STRINGdb$new( version="10", species=9606, score_threshold=900)
library(igraph)
g <- ss$get_graph()
from <- unique(ends(g,E(g))[,1])[1:10]
x <- data.frame("from" = ends(g,E(g))[,1], 
                "to" = ends(g,E(g))[,2], 
                "score" = E(g)$combined_score/1000)
library(cuRnet)
cg <- cuRnet_graph(x)
ret <- cuRnet_sssp_dists(cg, from)
```

The *cuRnet_sssp_dists* function takes the same arguments of *cuRnet_sssp* but returns just one NumericMatrix.
the returned matrix corresponds to the one returned by *cuRnet_sssp* and  indexed as *"distances"*.

The following line of code prints out distances along shortest paths from the first source vertex to every other vertex in the input network

```
ret[1,]
```
